# Q.1) write a python pro to sum of all items in list

# list1=[10,20,30,40,50]
# sum1=0
#     for x in list1:
#    sum1=sum1+x

# print("sum is" +str(sum))
# print(sum(list1))

# Q.2 ) wrirte a p.p to get the lqrgest no from a list
# list1=[10,50,40,20,25]
# m=list1[0]
# for x in list1:
#   if x>m:
#      m=x
#     print(m)


# Q.3) write a program to check a list is empty or not

# list1 = [10, 50, 40, 20, 90]

# if len(list1) == 0:
#   print("list is not empty")
# else:
# print("list is empty")

# Q.4)  write a p.p to count the no of strings where the string len os 2 or more and the 1st and last ch are same from a given list f strings
# sample list [ "abc" "xyz" "aba" "1221" ]
# expected result 2


# count = 0
# mylist = ['aa', "abc", "cc", "xyz", "aba", "1221"]
# for x in mylist:
#   if len(x) >= 3 and x[0] == x[-1]:
#       count += 1
# print(count)

# Q.5) write a pp to print the no of spectified ist after removing even noo from the list
#mylist = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
#list1 = [i for i in  mylist if i%2!= 0]
#print(list1)
